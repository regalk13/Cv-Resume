# Cv-Resume
This repo is just a example of the cv, resume that I have been using to get jobs for some time inspired on [Fancy cv](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.
