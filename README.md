# Cv-Resume
This repo is just a example of the cv, resume that I have been using to get jobs for some time inspired on [Fancy cv](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

# How to use

First of all you cant use this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh) and edit from overleaf. Or clone the repository and edit that of your own.

## Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed. [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, *nix) are available](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55437/how-do-i-update-my-tex-distribution) but TeX Live is recommended. [You can install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1092/how-to-install-vanilla-texlive-on-debian-or-ubuntu) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use sudo apt-get install texlive-full if you really want that. (It's generally a few years behind.)

## Usage

Run this on your terminal:
```
xelatex {cv-name}.text
```
